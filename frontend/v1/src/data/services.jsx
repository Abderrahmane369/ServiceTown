                        TV screens keep getting bigger and bigger, and TV mounts
                        keep getting better and better. Whether you want to
                        mount your TV on the living room wall, into steel studs,
                        or even onto an outdoor brick wall, there’s a mount that
                        can support your TV and a Tasker that can handle TV
                        installation for you at a reasonable rate.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Improve the view.</b>
                        <br /> Mounting your TV is a great way to ensure that
                        everyone in the room can see the screen. Some mounts
                        even come with the ability to angle or tilt your screen
                        for optimal viewing.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>Keep kids and pets safe.</b>
                        <br /> Mounting a TV on the wall is one of the best ways
                        to ensure it doesn’t fall onto any children or pets that
                        might come near it. Many TV mounts also come with cable
                        management components to help you keep wires off the
                        floor. No matter what kind of mount you have, Taskers
                        will install your TV so that it’s safe and secure.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <b>No tools? No problem.</b>
                        <br /> Taskers can bring all the tools necessary to help
                        install your TV—you just need to supply the mount. If
                        you’re able to confirm the wall type with your Tasker
                        beforehand, it will help ensure they bring the correct
                        tools. Standard wall types for TV mounts are drywall and
                        lathe and plaster.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Mounting into metal studs, brick, concrete, and
                        cinder block requires specific drilling tools. Your
                        Tasker will clean up after the task is completed,
                        leaving your home just the way it was upon arrival—but
                        with your TV right where you want it!
